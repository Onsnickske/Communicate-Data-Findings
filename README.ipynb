    "# Communicate Data Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "I checked through the datasets that were provided to us, I liked the Ford GoBike System Data so I explored some more through the available links. I ended up choosing the following website:\n",
    "https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data, the downloadable files, being in the following link.<br>\n",
    "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html<br>\n",
    "Here I was able to download the files I needed to gather one year of data. I chose the year 2020 and downloaded from Jan to Dec.<br>\n",
    "I saved this in a folder called Citibike-tripdata. This isn't attached to the submission, as it was too large.<p>\n",
    "The same goes for the dataframe where I merged all the 12 files together, to get a full year of data.<br>\n",
    "I amended my settings to allocate more memory to run some cells. I had 19 million rows in my dataframe, which I then merged with temperature data, cleaned and sampled. I took a sample of 1 Million rows, setting a seed for reproducability.<br>\n",
    "This 1 million samples is called merged_final, and then again merged_final_clean, once I took some extra cleaning steps.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "I was also able to extract information from the following site: https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/ny/new-york-city/date/2020-12.<br>\n",
    "This gave me access to data from the weather in New York, for the whole year of 2020. I gathered and cleaned this data ready for import.<br>\n",
    "I had to do some data wrangling on this dataset. Additionally to what's visible on the jupyter notebook, I also analyzed/wrangled this data in Excel. <br>\n",
    "This file is included for your perusal. You could download the citibike-tripdata monthly files and run the Communicate Data Findings ipynb file, as you have the rest of the data in the submission.<p>\n",
    "While the coded cells are there, I added # to them, to prevent me saving over my files.<p>\n",
    "Since you have the merged_final_clean file in the submission, my slide deck should work, and the HTML slide deck file should be operational, too.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's what we did to our data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We removed any records for unknown gender type.<br>\n",
    "- We changed the starttime and stoptime column to datetime format. Also changed the station ID's columns and bikeid column into strings.<br>\n",
    "- We changed the usertype and gender column into category format.<br>\n",
    "- We added some new columns for trip duration in minutes, and to show the Date, the hour of the day, day of the week and month.<br>\n",
    "- We changed the Date column in the weather dataframe to datetime and then back to string, to set it into the same order as the bt20 dataframe(2020-01-01), where the Date column is of type object.<br>\n",
    "- We merged the dataframes together. We kept all records and simply added the avg_temp, avg_wind_speed and Precipitation from the weathers table for the records already in the bt20 dataframe, merging on the Date column.<br>\n",
    "- We added a new column in the merged file for \"Age\".<br>\n",
    "- We filtered out any outliers, which we agreed were people older than 75.<br>\n",
    "- We cast the Age column to int type.<br>\n",
    "- We changed the hour of the day, day of the month and month to category type to help our plotting.<br>\n",
    "- We also removed those trips that were longer than 60 mins, which were outliers, to allow us to focus in on our records in more detail.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "I started my Univariate exploration by seeing how many trips were being taken by per hour, per day, and per month.<br>\n",
    "One observation we made here was that there was a significant drop in April, which was a result of Covid-19. <br>\n",
    "I also plotted a histogram for temperatures, to see how many bike rides there were in which temperature intervals. Nothing significant showed up there.<br>\n",
    "I checked the ages, where we spotted some outliers.<br>\n",
    "I checked the average duration and made a mistake, which I pointed out in my code, and included an image of the result, before fixing it and displaying the graph correctly.<br>\n",
    "For my Bivariate exploration I used a violin plot to show how trip duration varied by user type. This was useful to note that many more subscribers tend to use our bikes for shorter trips.<br>\n",
    "I analyzed the average trip duration per day of the week, seeing a significant increase on the weekend compared to the rest of the days.<br>\n",
    "We explored the usage of our system per hour, day of the week or month, splitting the user type, showing us the trend per user type.<br>\n",
    "In April the Subscriber type drops significantly, due to Covid-19 and the restrictions in NYC.<br>\n",
    "We analyzed the age via a box plot, showing that our subscribers group in general were older than the customer group. The Subscribers group's age varies more.<br>\n",
    "In the Multivariate exploration, I compared the average trip duration per day per user type.<br>\n",
    "Here we can see the consistency of the fast trips subscribers make to and from work on weekdays and how there is a big increase for this group in average duration on the weekend.<br>\n",
    "The heatmaps showed when most usage took place per user type, on which day and at which times. It was clear to once again see the patterns of work commute in the subscribers group.<br>\n",
    "Finally, we changed the temperature column into a 5 buckets, and labeled them.<br>\n",
    "This visualization showed that while customers and subscribers both tend to ride for longer, as the weather gets hotter, the subscriber group rides considerably longer on normal, hot and very_hot days compared to the rest of days.<p>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Key Insights for Presentation    \n",
    "    \n",
    "When exploring bike usage, we saw clear trends for Subscribers using our bikes at the same time every day, seeing two peaks at 8:00 and 17:00.<br>\n",
    "Therefore I chose to display this graph first via a bar chart, then used a heatmap, which helped us understand the distribution between both user types. <p>\n",
    "In the heatmap we can see that the peaks from the Subscribers type occurs only on weekdays, suggesting this is work commute.<br>\n",
    "On the Customer heatmap, we can see they are distributed mostly on weekends. Two distinct trends are visible in these groups.<p>\n",
    "Next I wanted to show the influence temperature may have on hiring a bike, per group. Splitting these into groups was essential, since both groups have a different mnindset when using our services. The Subscribers group showed that they tend to rent bikes evenly, regardless of the weather, while the Customer group rented more bikes, when the weather was hotter.<p>\n",
    "Lastly, I changed the temperature variable into a category of 5 buckets, and labeled them very_cold, cold, normal, hot and very_hot.<br>\n",
    "This allowed us to explore our data from a different perspective to gain additional understanding.<br>\n",
    "It showed us that while both users tend to ride for longer, as the weather gets hotter, the subscriber group rides considerably longer on normal, hot and very_hot days compared to the rest of days.<p>\n",
    "I made sure to label my charts correctly, so it can be understood.<p>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that I used my partner for feedback on my project.<br>\n",
    "While she was impressed, I think her opinion might be biased, so I'm crossing my fingers and hope you like it."
